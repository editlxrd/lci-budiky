/**
 * cluster_logo.js - G's Dash's logo in the instrument cluster's central map area while G's Dash is open
 * and no route guidance runs ("Logo in cluster when not navigating"), through the separately installed
 * "Cluster renderer" tool (cluster-render, robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps, from the Store).
 *
 * The rule (0.17.0, cluster_source.js): what G's Dash's pick says. Auto: hidden while route guidance runs
 * (NavigationStatus.guidingState ACTIVE, CarPlay's or Android Auto's projectedGuidanceActive, fed in by
 * main.js through guidance(): active for GUIDE_ON_MS -> hidden, off for GUIDE_OFF_MS -> back), else shown;
 * Logo and Music: always shown, route guidance or not, and exclusive (the whole map area ours: Waze's map
 * below it suspended, not drawn around the logo). It is one "content" layer at z NAV_Z (50), contending: over
 * a free-drive map (Waze on cluster's CarPlay map, content z 0; the service takes the slot over from the
 * stock map, the HMI's map parked behind it and back when the logo goes); under G's Music's (z 60/61) and
 * G's TV's (content z 100, exclusive, Auto only): never hidden for them - G's TV's exclusive layer suspends
 * ours and ours is back in the flush G's TV's goes, so the slot is never let go in between. With no
 * guidance signal answering, the logo still shows ("Shown - route detection unavailable"). Which signal
 * answers: guideLink() (main.js's watch results) and routeLine() ("Route: nav n/a · CarPlay off · AA n/a"),
 * on the Cluster & HUD page and in the log.
 *
 * Written for G's Dash from the tool's PROTOCOL.md and README, the way G's TV talks to it; it contains
 * none of the tool's code. The tool's own Node client is loaded at run time from where the tool
 * installs it, and only when that file and its directory are owned by root and writable by nobody
 * else (NG_CR_CLIENT / NG_CR_SOCK: a test client and socket, which skip that check):
 *     /var/opt/cluster-render/current/cluster_render_client.js
 *
 * The layer: one "image" layer on the "map" target only (slot 0x100, 1088x480, between the dials),
 * class "content" at z 50 (above Waze on cluster's CarPlay map, content z 0; under G's TV, content
 * z 100), contending (the stock map parks behind it), never exclusive, never "alert", never the panel or the HUD. The image is sent once: the regular logo (the badge's own
 * geometry, 448x240 on black, drawn 1:1 in the middle of the map area: 430 KB once), or with the Pixel
 * look the pixel-art emblem at its cell grid (27x15, 1.6 KB) drawn 16x by the cluster's GPU with
 * nearest sampling, so it stays crisp. A look change between the two sends the other image once (the
 * new layer first, then the old one goes). An image layer never stalls (stall_ms is for video only; an
 * image is drawn from its last pixels for as long as the layer exists), so nothing is sent to keep it
 * up: after the image, 0 bytes a second. The fade-in is the service's own (250 ms when the target is
 * shown). Only with the Pixel look and only while the car stands still: the emblem's stripes slide in
 * once and a shine crosses it every few seconds, as on the dash (whole 1.6 KB images, at most 12 a
 * second while a sweep runs: about 4 KB/s); moving, it is one still image and nothing more is sent.
 *
 * Whether the map area is in use (the service's own reports, nothing guessed):
 *   - other clients' layers on the map (for the page's lines only: none hides the logo, 0.17.0): the service's "status" text lists every client's layers
 *     ("layer N KIND of APP on TARGET, CLASS z Z: STATE[ - REASON]", then "  STATS": a video layer's
 *     "N sent, ...", an image layer's "N writes, ..."); asked for once a second over the local socket
 *     (nothing goes to the cluster). Only a layer that is actually drawing counts (drawing()):
 *       shown      the service draws it (visible, content within its own stall window, its target
 *                  shown): in use. A video layer that never sent a frame does not count.
 *       waiting /  visible but not drawn yet (target not shown or taken, under an alert): in use only
 *       suspended  while its frame counter is advancing (it moved within FRESH_MS), i.e. frames are
 *                  arriving and it draws as soon as the target is shown.
 *       stalled    visible but no content (no frame yet, or its frames stopped), hidden, error: idle.
 *     Waze on cluster makes its video layer as soon as it reaches the service and keeps it visible
 *     while CarPlay's cluster stream connection is up, frames or not: with CarPlay not streaming that
 *     layer is "stalled" (or "hidden"), registered but idle; drawing or not, it never hides the logo,
 *     which is over it. While G's TV's layer is drawing, ours stays visible, suspended under it.
 *   - the stock map (the HMI's own content in slot 0x100): our target's events say it ("parked" or
 *     "waiting", holder "stock"); the logo contends, so the service takes the slot over (the stock
 *     HMI's content only, at most every 3, then 10 s; the HMI's mapping parks behind ours and comes
 *     back when the logo goes). A contending app's take-over (G's TV) leaves the HMI's content parked
 *     behind it and shown again when it goes; the logo, contending too, takes it over again.
 *   - kept up (_tick, every POLL_MS while open): a connection that is not ready for RECONNECT_MS is
 *     made again; our layer missing from the service's list (once it was listed) or in error is made
 *     again (the image sent again); the client itself re-makes it whole after a reconnect.
 *   - after our slot was lost (a door-open warning or a phone reconnecting locks the slot and the
 *     KOMBI unmaps everything): nothing here (0.17.0); the service asks again as soon as the slot is free
 *     and takes it over from the stock map (cluster-render README "Arbitration").
 *   Not visible to a client: the stock map mapped AFTER the logo was shown (the user turns the cluster
 *   to Map view while G's Dash is open). The KOMBI never takes a slot from what it shows, so the stock
 *   map then waits behind the logo until G's Dash is closed or hidden (or the setting is turned off).
 *
 * 0.13.1, the look's own G (logo_core.js): with a shader look (M, GT, Digital '84, SimRacing, Lumen) the
 * logo is one "effect" layer at the same place (map, content z 50, contending): its fragment shader draws
 * that look's G, still (no u_time, no uniforms: the renderer stages and flushes nothing after it is made),
 * 0 bytes of the renderer's pixel budget. Fallbacks, in order: no effect layers in the client, the effect
 * refused, or its layer in error (did not compile) -> the look's baked picture logo_<look>.png (448x240,
 * 0.82 MiB budget, only the active look's ever loaded) -> the regular logo. Pixel: the emblem, as before.
 * A look change: to or from an effect, the new layer is made, then the old dropped (an effect holds no
 * pictures, so no two pictures are ever in memory together); picture to picture, the old is dropped first,
 * then a status asked, and the new made only once the renderer answered and FREE_MS passed (0.12.1's gate);
 * a change waits SETTLE_MS so stepping through looks makes one layer. The Pixel emblem's shine runs
 * only while the car stands still. A custom GIF uses the same image-layer writes and keeps playing
 * while the car moves (fitClusterGif: at most the emblem's on-screen 432 x 240).
 *
 * Off at once: hidden, closed, the setting off -> the layer is dropped (the service removes it at
 * once, no fade) and the connection closed; when the app ends its socket closes and the service
 * removes its layers. Never throws, never blocks. Node 8: no ?., ?? or object spread.
