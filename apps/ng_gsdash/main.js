/**
 * G's Dash - a driver display and car hub for the iDrive 7 (MGU) head unit, in seven looks.
 *
 *   - four screens, a horizontal swipe apart (page dots beside the G button, stopping at the ends):
 *     Drive (the look's dash, below; the screen the app opens on) · Warm-up (oil / coolant, the warm-up
 *     rev limit) · G-force (peak hold, hold a finger down to reset) · Tires (TPMS pressure / temperature).
 *     hub.js draws all but Drive. A cold start opens Warm-up and goes back to Drive by itself once warm
 *     (a swipe cancels that).
 *   - the drive mode badge: FES.statusFESVehicleDynamicSwitchHMI.actualValueModeDrivingExperience
 *     (car.js), shown by every look (Eco Pro, Comfort, Comfort+, Sport, Sport+, Individual)
 *   - shift lights over the last 2000 rpm before your shift point, gear (from the gearbox, or learned
 *     from rpm / speed when the car sends none), rpm, speed, a live g-meter with session peaks
 *     (accel / brake / lateral), oil and coolant in colour zones (0.11.0, lib.js TEMP_ZONES: blue cold,
 *     green normal, red too hot); mph, °F and psi unless Options > Units says km/h, °C, bar or kPa (0.13.6, units.js)
 *   - looks (setting "look", look_*.js): each its own layout, type, gauges and tab style -
 *     M Style (the default; 0.11.0: Carbon Grid), GT, Digital '84, Sim Racing, Lumen, Pixel (0.7.0). 0.9.0 took Simple, Heritage
 *     and Flight out: a saved one of those opens as M Style (migrated at start)
 *   - setting "panel": the right side of Drive. G-meter (the default), Spotify, or the Logo (the same
 *     picture as the widget and the cluster, including a per-mode GIF). Spotify is music.js (G's Music's
 *     code shared in by the build): what plays, art, previous / play-pause / next, a bar to tap or drag; its own QR sign-in
 *   - Options > Diagnostics (0.10.0: a plain entry, the 5-tap gesture went): Cluster - the tools'
 *     versions, the logo / skins / HUD state, the renderer's refusals, Waze on cluster's state, Refresh
 *     cluster, the alignment card and Stock redraw, the clock's source; Widgets - the HMI's widget
 *     layouts (read-only; a permission denial is said on the page); Audio - what the unit offers for sound
 *   - full screen, touch, GPU renderer (app.json "fullscreen": true): the G button opens Options
 *     (0.10.0: Theme, Cluster & HUD, Driving, Spotify, Diagnostics; every Options page has a Dash button
 *     at the top right back to the dash, the sub pages also "< Options"); Theme has the looks as a
 *     gallery (each card drawn once in software into a picture, so the looks' big fonts don't fill the
 *     renderer's shared glyph texture) and the right panel. Shift lights always in the Race colours
 *     (0.6.0 took that setting out). The Drive page's bottom bars are oil and coolant (0.9.0 took the
 *     fuel choice out: no reliable fuel signal for now). No demo data.
 *   - Logo (Options > Logo, setting "logo", was "widget"): the G mark by default, or a GIF sent from the
 *     phone with a QR code (kit gif_drop.js, the phone page web/widget/). The same choice is the home-screen
 *     widget (widget_logo.js, or the GIF played by kit widget_anim.js) and the cluster graphic (the look's
 *     own G, or that GIF, which keeps playing in the cluster while the car moves).
 *     Per driving mode (setting "logoPerMode", off by default): Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and any other mode
 *     the car reports (the same FES badge as the Drive screen, car.js) can each have a GIF. An empty slot
 *     keeps this Logo. The home widget and the cluster both follow the mode.
 *     The widget uses BMW's BasicWidget layout, whose picture has no mask (docs/animated-widget.md).
 *   - Options > Cluster source (0.8.3, cluster_source.js, setting "clusterSource", default Auto): what the
 *     cluster's centre map area shows - Auto (as before: the logo while G's Dash is open, G's Music over it
 *     while a track plays), Logo (also while G's Dash runs in the background), Music (G's Music's lyrics /
 *     visualizer, the logo when nothing plays), Map (Waze on cluster's CarPlay map) or Stock (the car's own;
 *     Waze on cluster has to be off). Route guidance always shows directions; G's TV only after its own
 *     Cluster button, and it yields to route guidance. The pick is shared with G's Music and G's TV in
 *     /dev/shm/ng-cluster/source.json, written only here (cluster_source.js has the rules).
 *     The logo: the G's Dash logo in the cluster's map area while no
 *     route guidance runs (cluster_logo.js, setting "clusterLogo" for Auto; the guidance from the car's
 *     navigation status and CarPlay's / Android Auto's, 0.7.4; 0.7.5: over Waze's map unless route
 *     guidance runs, shown too when no guidance signal answers; each signal's state on the page), and below it CarPlay's map on the
 *     instrument cluster (cluster.js), on / off, through the separately installed "Waze on cluster"
 *     tool's patch service: off unless the tool is installed and the user turns it on (with a
 *     confirmation); G's Dash stores nothing for it.
 *   - favourite looks (0.10.0, prefs.js; saved as "favLooks"): a star on each Theme card; with two or
 *     more, a tap on the gear (0.11.0: the gear only) on Drive switches to the next one (a toast says which). Not on a
 *     swipe or a moving finger, never while the shift lights build or flash. Looks that went drop out.
 *   - Spotify's controls (0.11.0, music.js): no boxes; 96-120 px targets 24 px apart or more, a filled
 *     play / pause circle, a soft disc pressed (stepped on Pixel), quiet targets (no kit press flash, a
 *     round controller ring); a 6 px seek bar with its times.
 *   - every clock H:MM with a colon (0.10.0, clock.js): the head unit's clock in its own zone (the car
 *     keeps it set). The session clocks are stopwatches: m:ss.t. The full-screen cluster test uses the same clock.
 *   - Dials & HUD (0.10.0, setting "displays", Options > Cluster & HUD): Cluster dials, G's Dash HUD,
 *     0.17.0 G's Music lyrics (on the HUD) or Car's own (the default) - one owner at a time (they share one
 *     scene), shared with G's Music and G's TV (cluster_source.js), Waze's HUD map off while one of ours owns
 *     it (waze_ctl.js). 0.9.0's two settings (clusterSkin, hudShift) are moved over once at start (prefs.js);
 *     0.17.0: G's Music's own HUD lyrics setting once, when the pick was Car's own.
 *   - cluster skins (0.8.0, cluster_skin.js, "displays" Cluster dials): with the cluster in
 *     its M / Sport layout (any drive mode), the cluster's own dials redrawn in the G's Dash look (the look switches the skin;
 *     Stock, the stock dials redrawn, from diagnostics), the telltales on top. 0.8.1: driving too - the
 *     speedometer, tachometer, digital speed and gear live from every car sample (car.onSample, 30 Hz at
 *     most); fuel, oil and the ACC / speed-limit / assist area left the car's own; back to stock when a
 *     value is over 300 ms old while moving, or anything is wrong. Diagnostics > Refresh cluster drops and makes
 *     again every G's Dash layer in the cluster (the logo takes the map back from the stock map). On the
 *     diagnostics page, parked: the alignment card (a 1 px outline of the measured geometry) and the
 *     Stock redraw.
 *   - HUD (gear, tach, shift lights) (0.13.0; 0.9.0-0.12.0 also showed the speed, 0.8.2 had the lights +
 *     gear; hud_shift.js, "displays" HUD): while open, the whole HUD in the look's style - the gearbox's
 *     own gear, big, D3 style (none in P or unknown; a guessed number: D alone) and a tach arc with the
 *     shift-light colours over the last 2000 rpm before the shift point (the whole arc flashing from it);
 *     the car's own HUD shows the speed. Any drive mode. No speed limit.
 *     Hidden on values over 300 ms old, no speed signal, demo data or a renderer error, and while G's TV
 *     plays on the HUD (back about 1 s after). The panel and the HUD share one scene: one at a time.
 *   - Full-screen cluster test (0.12.0, fcluster.js / fcluster_core.js, Options > Diagnostics, TEST): classic
 *     twin round dials over the whole cluster panel (1920 x 720), any gear or speed; covers the car's warning
 *     lights while on. Off by default and never saved (fcTest lives in memory only). The skins and the HUD
 *     are paused while it is on; it fades to stock on late values or anything wrong.
 *
 * Built on the idrive7-apps kit (kit/runtime). Node 8: no optional chaining, no ?? and no object spread.
